# Numbers

This is a little group project for groups of 3:

1. **Study the Expected Output**: Use the web page as a group and study the
   secret solution's output to understand what the site is supposed to do.
2. **Write the Utils**: On a new branch, each person should write tests for and
   solve one of the `/src/utils` functions. When you've finished your function
   send a PR so one of your group members can review and merge your code.
3. **Write the Interactions**: On a new branch, each person can write one of the
   user interactions. Be sure to use the shared `data` object! When you're
   finished you can send a PR for another group member to review and merge.
